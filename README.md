Calculation of date of Easter

Easter (or more accurately, Easter Sunday) has always been calculated as the first Sunday after the first full moon after the Northern Hemisphere's Spring Equinox...

Granted, this can be an absolute bitch to calculate. There are so many different algorithms out there... This function takes a numeric year and provides a string in `YYYYMMDD` format corresponding to the date that Easter Sunday falls.
